"""
Make multiple functions that will return the sum, difference, modulus, product, quotient, and the exponent respectively.

Please use the following function names:

addition = add

multiply = multiply

division = divide (both integer and float divisions are accepted)

modulus = mod

exponential = exponent

subtraction = subt

Note: All math operations will be: a (operation) b

add = lambda a, b: a + b
multiply = lambda a, b: a * b
divide = lambda a, b: a / b
mod = lambda a, b: a % b
exponent = lambda a, b: a ** b
subt = lambda a, b:a - b
