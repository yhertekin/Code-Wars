They say that only the name is long enough to attract attention. They also said that only a simple Kata will have someone to solve it series #1:
Are they opposite?

#Task
Give you two strings: s1 and s2. If they are opposite, return true; otherwise, return false. Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.

The opposite means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string. Also take note of the edge case - if both strings are empty then you should return false/False.

#Some examples:
isOpposite("ab","AB") should return true;
isOpposite("aB","Ab") should return true;
isOpposite("aBcd","AbCD") should return true;
isOpposite("AB","Ab") should return false;
isOpposite("","") should return false;
